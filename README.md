- âš¡ Fun fact: In 2017, Liverpool FC's data team convinced the manager to sign Mohammed Salah over other targets. He went on to become the historic club's 3rd leading goalscorer of all time and won the prestigious 'Player of the Year' award a record 3 times in 8 seasons.

Here is a snapshot of some of my projects:
# [WebOne Gadgets E-Commerce Analysis](https://github.com/Shree-Analyst/ECommerce_Trends_Analysis)
Launched in late 2018, WebOne is a global e-commerce platform selling popular electronics through its website & mobile app. This analysis focused on cleaning, validating, and analysing 100k+ sales transactions in Excel, SQL, and Tableau to extract insights relating to sales trends, seasonality, loyalty program performance, and refund rates. Recommendations included expanding the product portfolio and introducing new pricing tiers, focusing marketing efforts on 12 countries that make up 80% of revenue, and conducting a pipeline analysis to understand underlying causes behind high refund rates for laptops (16%).
